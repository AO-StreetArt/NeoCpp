/*! \page quickstart AOSSL Quick Start Guide
 *
 * ### Setup
 *
 * Before we begin, we need to build our dependencies and then build the project.
 *
 * #### Dependencies
 *
 * ##### Ubuntu16.04/Debian 7
 * The build_deps.sh script should allow for automatic resolution of dependencies.  Run the following command from the main folder
 *
 *     cd scripts/linux/deb/ && sudo ./build_deps.sh
 *
 * ##### CentOS 7/Redhat Enterprise Linux 7
 * The build_deps.sh script should allow for automatic resolution of dependencies.
 *
 * Before using the script, you will need to ensure that you have gcc version 5 or greater installed (By default, CentOS comes with gcc 4.8):
 *
 *     gcc --version
 *
 * If you do not see version 5 or above, you can likely use the devtoolset to get the latest one:
 *
 *     sudo yum install centos-release-scl
 *     sudo yum install devtoolset-7-gcc*
 *     scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
 *     which gcc
 *     gcc --version
 *
 * Then, run the following commands from within the main folder to resolve the other dependencies
 *
 *     cd scripts/linux/rhel/ && sudo ./build_deps.sh
 *
 * ##### Other
 * Please see instructions at https://github.com/cleishm/libneo4j-client.
 *
 * #### Install and Uninstall the Project
 *
 * The project can be installed on linux systems with:
 *
 *     sudo make install
 *
 * We can uninstall the libraries with:
 *
 *     sudo make uninstall
 *
 * #### Build the Tests
 *
 * Run the following to build the library test executable.
 *
 *     make tests
 *
 * The executable can be found under the test folder, it accepts a single command line argument which is the
 * address of the Neo4j instance to connect to.  By default, it will connect to the default Neo4j port on localhost.
 *
 * ## Use
 * Please continue on to the \ref use_index "Use" section of the documentation to see example uses of the library.
